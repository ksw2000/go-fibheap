# High-Efficiency Fibonacci Heap

Package fibheap implements a Fibonacci heap. A Fibonacci heap is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees.

In our implementation, we do not additionally track the key value of each element. Therefore, users should be aware that they should not insert elements with the same key value into the Fibonacci heap.
